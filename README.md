# Random-Color-Generator-Game
This is a very basic game that generates any random color when the button is clicked by the user.

The color is generated here by using the three basic colors i.e. red, blue and green which are then mixed in different proportions to get a random color. 




In JavaScript, Event Listeners are used here to  display the selected color in the place of the heading and to fill the box below with that random color
